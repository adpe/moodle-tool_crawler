Task timing setup
----------------


https://moodle.cqu.edu.au/local/linkchecker_robot/report.php?report=oversize


keep old links for always, 1 week, 1 month, never

* make a crawl stats table, when started, how many ticks, how many urls queued, how many links, how many broken urls, when finished

config for 'big' file size limit

mark a url to be rescraped next, delete all it's links and touch it's needscrape timestamp

make a cron / config for when we clean up old links and urls, default to a week ago

make all the reports work at course level, filter properly, crumb trails

add the big links to the block

be able to filter drill down to a course from admin report

fix bug MOODLE-786

* the robot
 - find links, create if needed the next pages, create if needed the links, touch the timestamp

 - and which isn't 'ignored' do we care?

* orphans pages?
 - if broken, clean them up (ie url was a typo, so we get an entry that will never work, remove it later when it's edge is gone)

* orphaned links?
 - do we remove them?

* capability
 - ignore a broken page
 - ignore a broken course link

* cross course links (mostly help? maybe the umbrella courses)
* most popular pages linked to

* do we also need a block to show some quick stats?
 - broken links, grouped by course pages
