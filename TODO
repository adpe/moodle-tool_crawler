move simple html dom to thirdparty dir and add xml stuff OR look for lib already in moodle?

keep old links for always, 1 week, 1 month, never

* make a crawl stats table, when started, how many ticks, how many urls queued, how many links, how many broken urls, when finished

config for 'big' file size limit

make a cron / config for when we clean up old links and urls, default to a week ago

add the big links to the block

be able to filter drill down to a course from admin report

fix bug MOODLE-786

* orphans pages?
 - if broken, clean them up (ie url was a typo, so we get an entry that will never work, remove it later when it's edge is gone)

* orphaned links?
 - do we remove them?

* capability
 - ignore a broken page
 - ignore a broken course link

* cross course links (mostly help? maybe the umbrella courses)
